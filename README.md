## JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication with Node.js and Auth0

JSON Web Token (JWT) is a low overhead option for authentication that is easy to implement and scales with your application. There is no need to store session data as everything you need is stored in an encoded string sent in the JWT, significantly reducing database overhead for your servers.

In this course, we will build a simple authentication server that will act as a token issuer, and we will use those tokens to access resources on an API. Starting from scratch, you will learn how easy token based authentication can be and will understand how to use them on your APIs as well as on the front end of your web applications.

## Start API/AUTH server

```shell
cd server
npm start
```
You should show the following message at the console

```
API Server listening on PORT 3000
Server listening on PORT 4000
```

## Start Front End
```shell
cd front
npm start
```

The front should be started on [http://localhost:3003/](http://localhost:3003/)
